==========================

This is a  sample application that demonstrates how [KGModal](https://github.com/kgn/KGModal) can be used in rubymotion apps

KGModal is an easy drop in control that allows you to display any view in a modal popup. The modal will automatically scale to fit the content view and center it on screen with nice animations!
